The code is working.  The permanent table of database maude that contains all paitent reports from 1994 up to today, is stored in the 'medwatch_report' table of the 'maude' database.
I need to separately backup the medwatch table into a separate database called 'medwatch' with one table called 'medwatch_report'.
